      Woah woah woah buttercup, before you start playing Minecraft with your 7
      year old roblox boyfriend, you need to get good at zombies!
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Take it from someone who has been playing for a year and STILL sucks at
      it!

  <p>1. Don't get the L-CAR9</p>
  <p>2. Don't play on hard maps</p>
  <p>
    3. You can only carry four perks (unless you have are some cheating no life
    who has a bunch of ridiculously over powered, strong, game breaking gobble
    gums), so choose your perks wisely. I recommend Juggernog, Widow's Wine,
    Speed-Cola, Mule Kick, and Stamin-Up.
  </p>
  <p>4. Try to get and keep Juggernog before round 10</p>
  <p>5. Manage your points well...</p>
  <p>Woah! What a cool transition into my next topic, points!</p>

  <p>
    6. On Black Ops 2 and 3, you can prone in front of a perk machine you can
    get extra points. Doesn't matter if power is on or off
  </p>
  <p>7. I wouldn't activate traps until after round 10</p>
  <p>
    8. Knifing zombies on round one is an instant kill, and killing zombies with
    a knife gives you more points, so don't use your gun at all on round 1
  </p>
  <p>
    9. On round two, shoot a zombie 4 or 5 times then knife it, it will give you
    more points and you will conserve ammo.
  </p>
  <p>
    10. THE RAYGUN IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT WAS IN EARLY COD ZOMBIES!!! THE RAYGUN
    ISN'T SPECIAL ANYMORE!!!
  </p>
  <p>
    11. To all of you 9 year olds, if a gun is automatic, it doesn't mean its op
  </p>
  <p>
    12. Training isn't very reliable on Cold War zombies. The zombies have
    different behavior, which sometimes leads to zombies not chasing after you.
  </p>
  <p>
    13. If you camp to much, sometimes it will lead to you not being able to get
    back out of your spot, so only camp for about 3 rounds, drink perks, Pack a
    Pucnch, etc. Then find a new spot to camp in.
  </p>
  <p>
    14. The first thing you should try to achieve as soon as you load into a map
    is to try and get the power on as perks and a few doors won't be available.
  </p>
  <p>
    15. Pack a Punch after the round is over, because then you won't have
    zombies swarming around you.
  </p>
  <p>
    16. Don't buy Cold War on apc with an AMD Radeon with Vega 8 graphics card,
    I speak with experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    17. Training is very reliable (unless your playing cold war), practice your
    training on the Ascension podieum
  </p>
  <p>
    18. Think about what gun you want to Pack a Punch because after you upgrade
    a trash gun, it will become an average gun.
